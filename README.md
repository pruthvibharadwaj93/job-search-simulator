I am only modeling the process of applying through the LinkedIn jobs section.

The flowchart attached, represents a daily snapshot of the process that Iâ€™m trying to simulate.

I am assuming the different steps of the process (like no.of applications, application success rate etc) to be random variables (green blocks)
Each of the random processes will be modeled using a prior-posterior distibution pair whose parameters will be determined based on my experience. 
There will be an option to change these parameters so that it can generalise to someone else's experience.

A daily snapshot of the simulator design is displayed below
